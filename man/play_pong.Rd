\usage{
play_pong(id)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{A unique module ID used for namespacing the UI elements and event handlers.}
}

A \code{tagList} containing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to run the Pong game

\description{
This function renders a self-contained Pong game UI and client-side JavaScript logic
as a Shiny module. It includes a canvas-based game interface with keyboard control,
scoreboard, and visual styling consistent with the Rcade package theme.
The game is initialised via a custom message (\verb{<id>-init}) and supports tab-aware
event listener management to prevent arrow key conflicts when the game is not active.
